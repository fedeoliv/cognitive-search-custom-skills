# Cognitive Search: Azure Search + Cognitive Skills (Python)

## Background

[Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-concept-intro) is an AI feature in Azure Search, used to extract text from images, blobs, and other unstructured data sources - enriching the content to make it more searchable in an Azure Search index. Extraction and enrichment are implemented through *cognitive* and *custom* skills attached to an indexing pipeline.
